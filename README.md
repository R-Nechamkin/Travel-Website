# Travel-Website
A group project of a website containing information about different countries, with a currency converter, map, and list of tourist activities.
<br>The information displayed in the website is stored in a database. PHP server-side code sends the information to the client-side Javascript which writes the webpage that the user sees.
<br>The website supports user accounts and keeps track of things like the user's home country and how much money the user has available to spend.
<br>API calls are used to provide real-time currency rates and a Google Map of the country.
